ok once and for all, linear or linear regressive models are mechanisms
which assign wights to contribution of individual factors to the
response/classification variable we seek, or rather

A key requirement is numerical observations only.

The classic way of dealing with continuous prediction is to write the
outcome as a linear sum of the attribute values with appropriate
weights, e.g., 
PRP = –55.9 + 0.0489MYCT + 0.0153MMIN + 0.0056MMAX + 0.6410CACH – 0.2700CHMIN + 1.480CHMAX

(The abbreviated variable names
are given in the second row of the table.) This is called a linear
regression equation, and the process of determining the weights is
called linear regression, a well-known procedure in statistics
