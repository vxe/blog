Apparently you can create bear notes from the command line [[http://www.bear-writer.com/faq/X-callback-url%2520Scheme%2520documentation/#create][like so]]. Lets try and create a note with

- title api test
- tage inbox/hello


should be 

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
bear://x-callback-url/create?title=api%20test?tags=inbox%2Fhello
#+END_SRC

and calling it with
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
open bear://x-callback-url/create?title=api%20test?tags=inbox%2Fhello
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

no dice. Well first of all double quote the whole thing, and use the ~&~ to separate the query parameters, yielding

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
open "bear://x-callback-url/create?title=api%20test&tags=inbox%2Fhello"
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

boom!  now for some elisp

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp :tangle bear.el
  (defun bear-new-note (title tags)
    (interactive "stitle: \nstags-string: ")
    (async-shell-command (concat "open "
                                "'"
                                "bear://x-callback-url/create?title="
                                (url-encode-url title)
                                "&"
                                "tags="
                                (if (not (string= "" tags))
                                    (url-encode-url tags)
                                  "emacs")
                                "'")))

#+END_SRC

and there you go, [[https://github.com/vxe/bear.el][bear tags in emacs]] .  I wish there was a non osx specific solution to this :\
