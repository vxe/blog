So one day my spotlight kind of just working, which was incredibly
annoying.  Apparently it use a tool called ~mdutil~ to do the indexing,
and poking it a couple of times will get the indexing going again.
As of Tue Aug 21 13:43:47 PDT 2018 , this command works

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo mdutil -i on -E /
#+END_SRC

and boom, your stupid spotlight index which breaks randomly, start
working again
