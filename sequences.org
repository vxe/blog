All of the statistical type computing that is so popular now can be
thought of as operating on collection of sequences, and grouping them
together as compound data and making statements about their properties.


a sequence is one of those structures that is so general, it may be
completely undetectable at all.  Integers are an example of an element
of a sequence.  However what is an integer but a sequence of bits?
Similarly a sequence is nothing but a sequence of characters which
underneath the covers are a sequence of bits.  Very recursive you know.
