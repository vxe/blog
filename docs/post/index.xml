      <description>I&#39;m pretty impressed with ansible. It honestly is the right tool for the job. It has a problem though. Its reliance on YAML. I feel this is where clojure can save the day. If only you had the following
(run-playbook inventory plays) A playbook in this regime is a sequence of &#39;plays&#39; which are clojure representation of the tasks which get composed out sequentially when writing a playbook.yml or the like.</description>
