The main difference between causal inference and inference of
association is that the former analyzes the response of the effect
variable when the cause is changed. The science of why things
occur is called [[file:./etiology][etiology]]. Causal inference is an example of causal
reasoning.


I suppose this means, it should *not* be in the [[file:./inference][inference]] section?

idk.  The /response/ of the 'effect variable'  when the cause is
changed?  


In other words, causal inference is alchemy.  It still seems useful
idk, its would be nice if you could easily determine cause and effect
by just looking at data.
