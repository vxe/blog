so the array, wtf is that?  Its a name for what might conventionally called
a contiguous of sequentially memory, disk or ram.  Obviously, an array is a 
far better name.  However its also used to describe vectors, which are 
1-d matricies, which can be /modeled/ using arrays but have additional
properties
