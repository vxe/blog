Input description: 

A set S of n points or more complicated geometric objects in k
dimensions.

Problem description: 

Construct a tree that partitions space by half-planes such that each
object is contained in its own box-shaped region.

Discussion: 

Kd-tree and related spatial data structures hierarchically decompose
space into a small number of cells, each containing a few
representatives from an input set of points. This provides a fast way
to access any object by position. We traverse down the hierarchy until
we find the smallest cell containing it, and then scan through the
objects in this cell to identify the right one.
