ok multivariate models, here we go....

from ze wikipedia

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Multivariate statistics is a subdivision of statistics encompassing
the simultaneous observation and analysis of more than one outcome
variable. The application of multivariate statistics is multivariate
analysis.
#+END_QUOTE

ok fine but what about the distinction between models and general
calculable statistics?  

Probably models which require look and more than one outcome of the
randomized process of which it is observing.  Sounds like a terrible
idea.
