In  [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) , two  [sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics))  are said to be disjoint sets if they have no  [element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_(mathematics))  in common. Equivalently, disjoint sets are sets whose  [intersection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory))  is the  [empty set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set) .[1]
