In  [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) , an order statistic tree is a variant of the  [binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)  (or more generally, a  [B-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree) [1]) that supports two additional operations beyond insertion, lookup and deletion:
*  [Select(i)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_algorithm)  — find the **i’**th smallest element stored in the tree
* Rank(**x**) – find the rank of element **x** in the tree, i.e. its index in the sorted list of elements of the tree
