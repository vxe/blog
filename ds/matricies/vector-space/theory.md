A vector space (also called a linear space) is a collection of objects called vectors, which may be  [added](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_addition)  together and  [multiplied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication)  ("scaled") by numbers, called **[scalars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(mathematics))**. Scalars are often taken to be  [real numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number) , but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by  [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number) ,  [rational numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number) , or generally any  [field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(mathematics)) . The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called  [axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom) , listed below.
