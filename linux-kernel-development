so most books make a pretty big deal about the whole syscall interface
as if this all that really mattered.  However the primary purpose of
the kernel is to provide an abstraction over hardware and such.  So
what are the hardware elements that you would want to abstract on a
digital computer.  Well...

- memory
- disks
- network-interfaces

Network interfaces is particularly interesting because we make a big
deal all the time about complicated networking is.  Its is, but most
of that complexity is routing architecture which facilitates the
internet.  From the operating system perspective, you are simply
pushing bytes to a stream output.
