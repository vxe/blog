So what it is AI, for me?  As far as I can hope, my only hopes for AI
are a codification of what it means to be an intelligent person, and
the through this the development of systems which off load the effort
required to induce this behavior to machines for the purposes of
raising the probability of it occurring spontaneously in a greater
percentage of the population than it normally would if human
intelligence alone were at play.

In short, AI for me is really IA, intelligence amplification.
